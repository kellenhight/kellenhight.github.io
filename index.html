    <h1>Home</h1>
    <p>
      Welcome to Kellen Hight's homepage. Here you'll find information about me,
      my resume, current projects I'd like to show off, and cool Open Source projects
      I want to shout out and thank. Thanks for taking a look!
    </p>
    <h2>What I'm Working On</h2>
    <p>
      Building a <a href="https://github.com/GEIGEIGEIST/TOTEM?tab=readme-ov-file" target="_blank"
        rel="noopener noreferrer">
        TOTEM Split Keyboard</a> has been my most recent personal project, and it was an absolute
      blast to build. This open-sourced keyboard design was quirky enough to get my interest but
      has been a breeze to use thanks to its non-traditional key layout. I've found it far more
      comfortable than the traditional layout, and it introduced me to layered keymaps, which have
      been super useful and efficient. If you're into this sort of thing,
      <a href="https://github.com/kmandarin-orange/totem-dongle-config" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
        here's my keymap</a>. Building a few of these with some friends was a great introduction
      to the keyboard hobby, and I'm considering building a couple more for fun sometime; something
      with a pointing device or a knob would be fun.
    </p>
    <p>
      Come back later! Cooler things are cooking...
    </p>
    <h2>Featured Web Links</h2>
    <p>
      These are some cool projects and resources I've found on the web, many of them
      Open Source. Give them a look if any pique your interest!
    </p>
    <ul class="featured-links">
      <li>
        <a href="https://github.com/GEIGEIGEIST/TOTEM?tab=readme-ov-file" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
          The TOTEM Split Keyboard</a> was mentioned in the previous section, but bears repeating because
        it's such a high-quality build with solid documentation and value. Very fun starter keyboard and
        an overall solid piece of open hardware.
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://humanewebmanifesto.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
          Manifesto for a Humane Web</a> gave me words for the beliefs I have about how the internet
        (and all software/electronics) should be built: as tools for humans. In the spirit of this
        paper, here's a couple Humane Web-related platforms that provide alternatives to the busy,
        heavy internet we've gotten used to:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <a href="https://joinmastodon.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mastodon - Decentralized
              social media</a>
            A great Twitter/X alternative in these trying times. People here are friendly, and I've found I enjoy
            the experience of only seeing posts from people/tags I follow, as opposed to an algorithm.
          </li>
          <li>
            <a href="https://join-lemmy.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lemmy - Link aggregator for the
              Fediverse</a>
            A Reddit alternative. Like Mastodon, I've also found the people here friendly and helpful, and there's
            plenty of niche and interesting communities to follow.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Rust Programming Language</a>
        One of the new memory-safe languages on the block these days, I've been enjoying learning it and like how it
        enforces very specific software design to minimize unexpected behavior through its super helpful compiler.
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://elementary.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Elementary OS</a>
        My first real experience with Linux and Open Source software. I still have a special place in my heart for
        this project and what it's done for improving user interface design in the Linux desktop space.
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fedora Linux</a>
        I've settled on this Linux distribution as my main OS after my initial years of exploration, and it's been
        stable and comfortable. I wrote this website from my laptop running Fedora!
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://pi-hole.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pi-Hole Self-hosted DNS adblocker</a>
        Nice little service to tinker with, handy for learning about DNS and networking. Has the added bonus of extra
        protection against more malware/phishing domains than ISPs usually provide with their DNS servers.
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://syncthing.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Syncthing - File syncing service</a>
        Far and away one of the most useful services I run for myself. It's a handy solution for sharing folders and
        files that you want multiple devices to have, like a music collection or school notes.
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://obsidian.md/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Obsidian - Flexible writing app</a>
        This is a Markdown notes editor/writing app/personal wiki, and I use it almost daily. It's well-suited for
        taking
        notes and connecting concepts with its cross-page linking, and the Canvas feature is great for building visual
        connections between notes and images while studing for an exam. Genuinely one of the most powerful apps I use!
