    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>
      My name is Kellen Hight (he/him), I'm an American student studying computer science
      and visual communication/graphic design. I'm deeply passionate about making useful
      technology easy to use for everyone, as well as digital freedoms as a vector for
      improving social cohesion and reinforcing real-world rights. Hobbies include playing
      guitar, sketching, listening to music, and finding new electronics projects to do.

    <h2>Credits & Gratitude</h2>
    <p>
      There are a number of people and resources that have been helpful during my education
      and professional development. I'd like to thank a few of those people here
      and shout out some great resources that have helped me learn.
    </p>
    <h3>People</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>The Elementary OS team</b> - the Linux distro they created was what got me into software
        design, and I'm very thankful for their work in the open source ecosystem. Their old
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@elementaryinc/streams" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
          development streams</a> were educational and gave me the spark to pursue designing
        beautiful, accessible software.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Allie Lousch</b> - supervisor at a prevoius workplace, was greatly influential
        in my professional development and guided me in my grapic design/marketing endeavors.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>My advisors</b> - my college advisors have given me the guidance to succeed. Special
        thanks goes to David Invergo and Elli Archer for their support!
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Places (on the Web and in the Real World)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="https://lib.k-state.edu/technology/innovation-lab/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
          The Innovation Lab at K-State</a> has provided me the tools to tinker and explore electronics
        and 3D printing while I amass my own collection of tools and equipment. The tools and assistance
        provided here has helped me get better at my passions without costing me a prohibitive amount of money.
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The iFixit guides</a>
        allowed me to cut my teeth on basic electronics repair and modification. I owe a lot of what I've
        learned about soldering and repair to the community that's maintained these resources.
